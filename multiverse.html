        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 60px;">
            Somewhere in the multiverse, the boy still thinks:<br>
            Could there be a different story?
        </p>

        <p>The first time she saw him, he was just a silhouette against the window. He was the boy who didn’t try to be seen, and for some reason, that made her look.</p>
        
        <p>In a classroom full of boys trying to be the loudest or the fastest, he was just… still.</p>
        
        <p>She started coming to class and looking for that stillness. She’d turn around to "ask for a pen" or "check the date," but really, she just wanted to see if he’d look back.</p>

        <div class="glass-box">
            <p class="her-voice">Sometimes their eyes would meet, and her heart would do this annoying, frantic skip. She’d turn away quickly, terrified that her face was turning as red as her notebook cover.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The day she missed school, all she could think about was whether he noticed her seat was empty. She hoped he did. She hoped the classroom felt as quiet to him as her room felt to her.</p>

        <h2>Class 10: The Shifting Distance</h2>

        <p>By Class 10, the "window boy" had become her favorite part of the day. She started making up excuses to talk to him. <em>"Do you have the notes for Physics?" "Did you understand what she said about the boards?"</em></p>

        <p>He was always so kind when he answered. There was no ego, no performance. She loved the way he spoke—quiet, steady.</p>
        
        <p>Every time he answered a question, she’d linger for a second too long, waiting for him to say something else. Something personal. Something that wasn't about school.</p>

        <p class="her-voice">But he never did.</p>

        <p>She started looking back at him more often, not even bothering with the excuses anymore. She just wanted to catch his eye. Sometimes she did. She’d give him a small smile, a silent "I see you," but he’d look away so fast she started to wonder if she was bothering him.</p>

        <h2>The Misunderstanding</h2>

        <p>When they were put in the same project group, she thought, <strong>This is it.</strong> This was the universe giving her a chance. They talked more. They laughed. For the first time, the wall between the window seat and the middle row felt thin.</p>

        <div class="glass-box">
            <p>Then came that afternoon by the stairs.</p>
            <p>She was talking to a guy from another section—someone she'd known since primary school, someone who felt like a brother. He’d told a stupid joke, and she laughed because it was a long day and she was tired.</p>
            <p>Out of the corner of her eye, she saw him.</p>
            <p>He was walking past, and for a second, he stopped. She wanted to wave. She wanted to call him over and introduce them. But the look on his face… it wasn't the "still" look she loved.</p>
            <p style="color: #ffd700;">It was something else. Something cold.</p>
        </div>

        <p>He walked away before she could say a word.</p>
        
        <p>After that, everything changed. He went back to the way he was in Class 9—distant, unreachable. When she’d try to start a conversation, he’d give her one-word answers. The warmth was gone.</p>

        <p>She spent the weeks leading up to the board exams crying into her pillow, wondering what she’d done wrong.</p>

        <h2>The Farewell</h2>

        <p>On the last day, she stood by her bench, waiting. She stayed later than usual, hoping he’d walk over. She wanted to tell him that she’d stay at the same school for Class 11. She wanted to ask him where he was going.</p>
        
        <p class="her-voice">She wanted to say, "Please don't go where I can't find you."</p>

        <p>But when they spoke, it was just "Good luck" and "See you." A polite, empty smile.</p>

        <p>She watched him walk out of the classroom for the last time. She stayed in that school for two more years, sitting in that same middle row, constantly glancing at the window seat. But it was always occupied by someone else. Someone who wasn't him.</p>

        <div class="dream-end">
            <p>Years later, she sees him in the city sometimes. Her heart still does that same skip, even after all this time.</p>
            <p>She wants to run up to him. She wants to tell him about the project, about the stairs, about how she used to memorize the way the sunlight hit his hair in the afternoons.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But she doesn't. He looks at her like she’s a stranger from a story he’s already finished reading.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif; font-style: italic; color: #ffd1dc; margin-top: 40px;">
                So she just walks past, keeping her secret buried in Class 10,<br>right where he left it.
