            <div class="subtitle">CLASS 9</div>
            <div class="hook-quote">
                “Everything around him looked normal, but nothing felt settled.”
            </div>
        </header>

        <p>New classroom. New uniform. New school.</p>
        
        <p>Class 9 began like most new beginnings do — without drama, without warning. The building felt unfamiliar, the corridors slightly confusing, and the uniform still felt stiff, like it hadn’t accepted him yet. Everything around him looked normal, but nothing felt settled. He chose a seat near the window, not because he liked the view, but because it allowed distance. From there, he could observe without being noticed.</p>
        
        <p>He wasn’t the kind of boy people remembered easily. He spoke when needed, laughed when expected, and stayed quiet otherwise. School had always been a place he passed through, not a place that stayed with him. And that was exactly how he expected Class 9 to be.</p>
        
        <p>Just another year.</p>

        <p>The first few days went exactly that way. Teachers introduced themselves, rules were repeated, notebooks filled with fresh handwriting. Faces slowly became familiar. Noise settled into routine. Nothing stood out. Nothing felt important enough to hold onto.</p>

        <div class="separator"></div>

        <p>Then one morning, during attendance, the classroom door opened.</p>
        
        <p>A student walked in late. The teacher paused, the class turned for a second, and then everything continued as usual. She apologized softly and took an empty seat somewhere in the middle rows. There was nothing special about the moment. No one paid attention for long.</p>
        
        <p>Neither did he.</p>
        <p>At least, not then.</p>
        
        <p>Days passed, and Class 9 slowly found its rhythm. The boy followed it without resistance. He sat by the window every day, watched sunlight fall on desks, listened to half the lectures, and waited for the bell like everyone else. Life felt simple. Predictable.</p>

        <div class="glass-memory">
            <p>Somewhere in those ordinary days, he began noticing her.</p>
            <p>Not deliberately.</p>
            <p>Not immediately.</p>
            <p>It started with small things. The way she listened when teachers spoke. The way she wrote neatly, as if handwriting mattered. The way she smiled when friends teased her — easily, without thinking.</p>
            <p>It didn’t feel like attraction.</p>
            <p>It felt like awareness.</p>
            <p>She existed in the classroom the way background music exists — not demanding attention, but missed when absent.</p>
        </div>

        <p>They didn’t talk.</p>
        <p>There was no reason to.</p>
        
        <p>Sometimes a notebook passed through benches. Sometimes a homework doubt was exchanged. Their words never went beyond what was necessary. Their interactions were brief, forgettable to everyone else.</p>
        
        <p>But from his seat near the window, he saw her often.</p>
        
        <p>He saw her lean forward during lectures. He saw her laugh during free periods. He saw how she seemed comfortable being exactly where she was.</p>
        
        <p>He never tried to get closer.</p>
        <p>Distance felt natural.</p>

        <div class="pause-gap">
            ...
        </div>

        <p>One day, she didn’t come to school.</p>
        
        <p>The class continued as usual. Teachers taught. Friends talked. The bell rang. But during attendance, his eyes lifted toward the door without intention. Her seat stayed empty, and for the first time, the classroom felt slightly incomplete.</p>
        
        <p>He didn’t understand why that bothered him.</p>
        
        <p>It wasn’t sadness.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t worry.</p>
        <p>It was just absence — noticeable, quiet.</p>
        
        <p>When she returned the next day, nothing was said. Nothing needed to be. The classroom felt whole again, and he pretended he hadn’t noticed the difference.</p>
        
        <p>Some realizations were easier to ignore.</p>

        <div class="separator"></div>

        <p>As weeks passed, familiarity grew.</p>
        <p>They weren’t friends.</p>
        <p>They weren’t strangers.</p>
        <p>They simply shared the same space every day.</p>
        
        <p>Occasionally, their eyes met accidentally. Both looked away quickly, like the moment hadn’t happened. Sometimes, she turned back to ask something, and he answered without thinking too much about it. Their conversations never lasted long enough to become memorable.</p>
        
        <p>And yet, they stayed with him.</p>

        <p>Halfway through the year, something shifted — quietly.</p>
        
        <p>One afternoon, while the teacher explained something no one seemed interested in, she laughed softly at something her friend said. It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t meant for attention. But for a moment, the rest of the classroom faded.</p>

        <div class="epiphany-container">
            <div class="epiphany-text">
                That was when he realized it.<br>
                He liked her.<br>
                Not loudly.<br>
                Not desperately.<br>
                Just enough to matter.
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>After that, his attention changed. He noticed when she entered the classroom. He noticed when she wasn’t around. He noticed how school days felt lighter when she was present.</p>
        
        <p>Still, he didn’t act.</p>
        <p>He didn’t move seats.</p>
        <p>He didn’t start conversations.</p>
        <p>He didn’t change anything.</p>
        
        <p>Watching from a distance felt safer than risking the comfort he already had.</p>
        
        <p>By the end of Class 9, she had become part of his routine.</p>
        <p>Not someone he knew deeply.</p>
        <p>Not someone he talked to often.</p>
        <p>Just someone whose presence made ordinary days feel better.</p>
        
        <p>He didn’t think about love.</p>
        <p>He didn’t imagine futures.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 60px; font-weight: 700;">He only knew this —</p>
        <p>school felt different now.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 40px; font-style: italic; opacity: 0.8;">And at that moment, that felt enough.</p>
        
        <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px; font-size: 0.8rem; letter-spacing: 2px; text-transform: uppercase;">
