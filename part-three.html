            <h1>Part Three</h1>
            <div class="subtitle">The End</div>
        </header>

        <p>Class 10 was still going on...</p>
        <p>Nothing dramatic. Nothing loud. Just one ordinary afternoon that stayed with him longer than it should have.</p>
        
        <p>The pressure of boards had started showing on everyone. Teachers rushed chapters. Friends spoke in marks and ranks. Laughter still existed, but it came less often now, like people were saving it for later.</p>
        
        <p>He still sat near the window. She still sat in the middle rows.</p>
        <p>And for a while, everything stayed the same.</p>

        <div class="divider-solid"></div>

        <p>It began with a school project.</p>
        <p>One of those compulsory group activities that teachers believed would teach responsibility. Groups were assigned randomly. His name appeared on the list. So did hers.</p>
        
        <p>That moment mattered to him more than he expected.</p>
        
        <p>They worked together — not closely, not emotionally — just practically. Notes exchanged. Deadlines discussed. Conversations stretched a little longer than before. Nothing personal. Nothing risky.</p>
        
        <p>But it felt important.</p>
        
        <p>Talking to her felt easy now. Normal. Comfortable. Like something that had taken time to reach this point. For the first time, he wondered if distance had only existed because he had kept it alive.</p>
        
        <p>Maybe there was still time.<br>Maybe he hadn’t been late.</p>

        <div class="fracture-box">
            <p>Then one day, something small happened.</p>
            <p>It was during lunch break.</p>
            <p>He was walking past the corridor near the classrooms when he saw her standing near the stairs. She was talking to another boy. Someone from school he recognized but never really noticed.</p>
            <p>She laughed.</p>
            <p>Not politely. Not briefly.</p>
            <p>She laughed freely, the way she always had.</p>
        </div>

        <p>He stopped without meaning to.</p>
        <p>Nothing about the scene was wrong. Nothing inappropriate. Nothing that needed explanation. And yet, something inside him tightened.</p>
        
        <p>He walked away before either of them noticed him.</p>
        
        <p>The rest of the day passed normally. Classes continued. Teachers spoke. Notes were copied. But his attention wasn’t where it usually stayed.</p>
        
        <p>That image followed him. Her laughing. Not with him.</p>

        <p>And slowly, his mind began filling the gaps.</p>
        
        <div class="silence-box">
            <p>He didn’t know who that boy was to her.</p>
            <p>He didn’t know what they were talking about.</p>
            <p>He didn’t know if it meant anything at all.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-style: italic; opacity: 0.7;">But assumptions don’t wait for answers.</p>
        </div>

        <p>He told himself this explained everything. That maybe she had always been closer to someone else. That maybe what he felt had never existed beyond his side. That maybe he had mistaken comfort for connection.</p>
        
        <p>She never confirmed any of this. She never denied it either.</p>
        <p>And that silence became enough.</p>

        <div class="divider-solid"></div>

        <p>After that day, something shifted in him. Not suddenly. Not visibly.</p>
        <p>He still spoke to her when needed. Still finished the project. Still smiled when expected. But the ease was gone. Conversations felt shorter. Glances felt heavier.</p>
        
        <p>Distance returned — this time, chosen.</p>
        
        <p>Boards came closer. Time began slipping faster. School started feeling temporary in a way it never had before. Everyone spoke about the future now — colleges, streams, what came next.</p>
        
        <p>She spoke about her plans too. Same school. Same place. Nothing was changing for her.</p>
        
        <p>He listened quietly.</p>
        <p>And that’s when he understood something clearly — if anything was going to change, it would be him.</p>

        <p>The last days before boards were quiet. No one said proper goodbyes. Everyone pretended this wasn’t ending. On the last day, they spoke briefly. Nothing emotional. Nothing unfinished on the surface.</p>
        
        <p>Just a simple exchange. A familiar smile. A moment that passed.</p>
        
        <p>He watched her walk back to her bench, surrounded by the same classroom she would return to again.</p>
        
        <p>And he realized — this place would never feel the same to him again.</p>

        <div class="divider-solid"></div>

        <p>Boards ended.</p>
        <p>School ended.</p>
        <p>And he left.</p>
        
        <p>Not because he had to. But because staying felt heavier than leaving.</p>
        
        <p class="fading-text">He changed schools after boards. New uniform. New classrooms. New faces. An attempt to move forward.</p>

        <div class="buried-memory">
            <p>Years later, he still sometimes sees her.</p>
            <p>Not often. Not clearly.</p>
            <p>In crowds. At traffic signals. In places where memory mistakes familiarity for presence.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But every time he looks closer, something feels wrong.</p>
            <p>She is still there — in the same city, the same world.</p>
            <p>But she isn’t the girl he fell for.</p>
            <br>
            <p>That girl stayed behind in Class 10. In that classroom. In that uniform. She didn’t move on with him. That version of her did not survive the boards.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And he buried her quietly, somewhere inside himself — where old memories rest without asking to be remembered.</p>
            <br>
            <p>He never approaches her. Not because he is scared.</p>
            
            <div class="final-lines">
                But because some things are already over —<br>
                even if they never properly began.
